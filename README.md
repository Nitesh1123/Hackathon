Optimizing Doctor Availability and Appointment Allocation in Hospitals through Digital Technology and Al Integration

To develop a digital system that streamlines the appointment scheduling process in hospitals by automating the process of identifying doctor availability and appointment slot allocation. The system will utilize advanced technologies such as RFID, face detection, proximity of Mobile phone, or any other relevant technology to detect the presence of doctors in the hospital. The system will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to allocate appointment slots based on the doctor's presence and the number of waitlisted patients. This will improve the overall patient experience by reducing the wait time. In conclusion, the proposed digital system will improve the efficiency and convenience of the appointment scheduling process in hospitals; the patients will benefit with reduced waiting time.
